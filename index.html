                              Imagine being passionate about your job, solving complex problems, working on interesting projects, and earning a high salary.

                              Maybe youâ€™re bored at your current job. Maybe you feel stuck with no room to grow, or perhaps you wish you had the option to work remotely or even freelance. If any of these sound like you, it may be time to make a change.
                              
                              It might be time to consider becoming a developer.
