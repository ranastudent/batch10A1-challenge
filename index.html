                              Imagine being passionate about your job, solving complex problems, working on interesting
                              projects, and earning a high salary.

                              Maybe you’re bored at your current job. Maybe you feel stuck with no room to grow, or
                              perhaps you wish you had the option to work remotely or even freelance. If any of these
                              sound like you, it may be time to make a change.

                              It might be time to consider becoming a developer.

                                    establish where to take their career by setting goals. These goals can be different
                                    areas of their career or they can progress toward a specific end goal. Accomplishing
                                    goals can help developers create a career that aligns with what they want. They can
                                    set expectations and use goals as individual steps to help them achieve those
                                    expectations. Taking the time to consider and plan their goals can help them decide
                                    what to accomplish and how.</p>
